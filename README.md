# FaceShield

This is a design for a lightweight face shield, made from laser-cut clear sheet plastic and a specialized 3D-printed screw. The design is suitable for fast production and is comfortable to wear.

*IT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS BY ANY MEDICAL AUTHORITY*

Sheet plastic can be polystyrene or polycarbonate\*, 0.015" to 0.030"\* in thickness and 12" (300mm) square in size. Other materials and thicknesses may be usable. The sheet should comply nicely with the curved shape but not fold freely.
PETG\* 3D-printed specialized screw can be replaced with rivets if a 3D printer is not available.

Feel free to fork or contribute in any way. Feedback is welcome.
